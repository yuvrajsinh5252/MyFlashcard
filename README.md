    Flip Card: Implement a feature that allows users to click on a flashcard to flip it and reveal the answer.
    Next/Previous Navigation: Allow users to navigate through the set of flashcards using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.

Internal Dashboard:

        Add Flashcards: Insert new flashcards, including the question and answer.
        Edit Flashcards: Update the content of existing flashcards.
        Delete Flashcards: Remove flashcards from the set.
